  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">There</span> was no day I<span class="S-T">’</span>d miss hearing that name.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Tsukimori is so lovely<span class="S-T">…</span>,<span class="S-T">”</span> muttered my classmate Kamogawa, sighing, upon which the other male students around him nodded deeply.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Listen guys: don<span class="S-T">’</span>t let that slender body deceive you! Got me? She<span class="S-T">’</span>s also got<span class="S-T">…</span>boobs!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Their</span> <span class="S-T3">insolent</span> <span class="S-T3">gazes</span> <span class="S-T3">were</span> <span class="S-T3">focu</span><span class="S-T3">sed</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">girl</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">debate,</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori,</span> <span class="S-T3">who</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">surrounded</span> <span class="S-T3">by</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">group</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">chattering</span> <span class="S-T3">girls.</span> <span class="S-T3">If</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">were</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">describe</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">one</span> <span class="S-T3">word:</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">eye-catching.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Don<span class="S-T">’</span>t you agree Nonomiya?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>If you say so.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Wow,</span> <span class="S-T3">now</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">cold</span> <span class="S-T3">reply!</span> <span class="S-T3">Are</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">really</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">ma</span><span class="S-T3">n?</span> <span class="S-T3">If</span> <span class="S-T3">there</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">mountain,</span> <span class="S-T3">climb</span> <span class="S-T3">it!</span> <span class="S-T3">If</span> <span class="S-T3">there</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">beautiful</span> <span class="S-T3">chick,</span> <span class="S-T3">fall</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">her!</span> <span class="S-T3">Isn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">what</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">means</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">man?</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The guys, led by Kamogawa, began to show over-exaggerated reactions to my indifferent answer.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Well, I just thought she<span class="S-T">’</span>s perfect.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">She</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">beautiful</span> <span class="S-T3">face,</span> <span class="S-T3">supplemented</span> <span class="S-T3">by</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">nice</span> <span class="S-T3">figure</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">outstanding</span> <span class="S-T3">grades.</span> <span class="S-T3">Her</span> <span class="S-T3">pleasing</span> <span class="S-T3">personality</span> <span class="S-T3">made</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">rather</span> <span class="S-T3">popular.</span> <span class="S-T3">Apparently,</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">also</span> <span class="S-T3">good</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">sports.</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">seemed</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">perfect</span> <span class="S-T3">girl</span> <span class="S-T3">without</span> <span class="S-T3">anything</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">complain</span> <span class="S-T3">about.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>How<span class="S-T">’</span>s that bad?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I never said it<span class="S-T">’</span>s bad. It<span class="S-T">’</span>s just that I can<span class="S-T">’</span>t relax around her.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Aah, that<span class="S-T">’</span>s true. Tsukimori is a girl beyond our reach after all<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">Fortunately,</span> Kamogawa interpreted my statement to his convenience.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">My honest impression was that she was so perfect it was boring and being around her would be suffocating. Maybe it<span class="S-T">’</span>s just that my personality is a little warped, but I<span class="S-T">’</span>ve secretly been keeping a distance from Tsukimori because I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t discover a common ground between us.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, the guys seemed to be highly interested in the famous girl and started discussing rumors about Tsukimori as if they were gossiping about some star.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But I heard she has a boyfriend in college?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Student <span class="S-T">‘</span>K<span class="S-T">’</span>, was it? That guy who<span class="S-T">’</span>s three years older than her?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Eh? I heard she was the lover of a company president<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Aah, so that<span class="S-T">’</span>s why she gets ¥200,000 in allowance every month?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No kidding! But I heard someone spotted her together with math teacher Kumada when they came out of a love hotel!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">There was no need for a metaphor anymore<span class="S-T">—</span>she really was a star. I once more realized how special she was.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">But then again, she might not have been happy about that special status. At least I wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t be able to stand it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>It<span class="S-T">’</span>s all just rumors without any credibility whatsoever.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">A short laugh escaped my mouth because they were discussing this stuff all too seriously and energetically.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Why don<span class="S-T">’</span>t you just ask her directly?<span class="S-T">”</span> Therefore, I confronted them with that question. Just for fun. And as expected, my idea was rejected with vigor close to booing.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>As if we could ask her something like that!!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Because I was so amused by their reaction, I spurred them on a little more. <span class="S-T">“</span>If you want, I can go ask as the representative of the class?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Wait wait wait!! Nonomiya! Don<span class="S-T">’</span>t rush things! What are we gonna do if the rumors turned out to be true?<span class="S-T">”</span> Kamogawa rebuked me in a hurry.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Maybe they really are just rumors?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But maybe it<span class="S-T">’</span>s all true!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The other guys nodded in agreement to Kamogawa, <span class="S-T">“</span>Possible. If it<span class="S-T">’</span>s Tsukimori, very possible!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Sure</span> <span class="S-T3">enough</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">stood</span> <span class="S-T3">out</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">this</span> <span class="S-T3">class.</span> <span class="S-T3">You</span> <span class="S-T3">could</span> <span class="S-T3">even</span> <span class="S-T3">say</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">different</span> <span class="S-T3">nature.</span> <span class="S-T3">No</span> <span class="S-T3">wonder</span> <span class="S-T3">everyone</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">under</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">impression</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">already</span> <span class="S-T3">experienced</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">world</span> <span class="S-T3">unbeknownst</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">high</span> <span class="S-T3">school</span> <span class="S-T3">students;</span> <span class="S-T3">considering</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">acted</span> <span class="S-T3">so</span> <span class="S-T3">ma</span><span class="S-T3">turely</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">hard</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">believe</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">our</span> <span class="S-T3">age.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>The truth is hidden in the dark, huh?<span class="S-T">”</span> Whatever that truth might have been, I could take it easy since I wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t be hurt by it like Kamogawa and the others.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>The truth isn<span class="S-T">’</span>t always what<span class="S-T">’</span>s best, is it?<span class="S-T">”</span> But it looked like they couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t take it as easily since the truth would bother them much more.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Don<span class="S-T">’</span>t you find this unproductive? If you keep your eyes averted from the truth, you won<span class="S-T">’</span>t ever be able to obtain what you seek!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>We don<span class="S-T">’</span>t care! A couple of days ago, some idiot confessed to her and got harshly rejected. If you carelessly try to reach out for something on a different level, you<span class="S-T">’</span>re only going to fall down and hurt yourself. I prefer the ideal over the truth! You could even say we want Tsukimori to remain the source of our fantasies for all eternity.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was so amazed at this bunch that I could only laugh. <span class="S-T">“</span>Adolescence is wonderful, isn<span class="S-T">’</span>t it?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Hey, we<span class="S-T">’</span>re seventeen! Leave us our dreams!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Apparently I wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t supposed to laugh.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I shall not bother you anymore if you all insist.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>We do, we do! Don<span class="S-T">’</span>t crush the dreams of us delicate boys.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You mean <span class="S-T">‘</span>impure high school boys<span class="S-T">’</span>.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Who is our dear Nonomiya fond of then? No celebrities allowed, by the way.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Kamogawa launched an unexpected counterattack. The other guys, too, jumped at the chance and closed ranks by leaning forward and urging, <span class="S-T">“</span>Tell us! Tell us!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Well, let<span class="S-T">’</span>s see<span class="S-T">—”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">To tell the truth, there was no girl who I could have mentioned specifically, but looking at the situation I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t believe those impure high school boys would content themselves with that.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>I think Usami<span class="S-T">’</span>s cute.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I merely spoke out the first name that came to mind right then, but they all seemed rather disappointed and made awkward faces.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>How unthrilling. It couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t get any more ordinary, could it? You<span class="S-T">’</span>re so boring,<span class="S-T">”</span> complained Kamogawa.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">So</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">claim</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T4">not</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">ordinary</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">feel</span> <span class="S-T3">attracted</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori?</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I admit she<span class="S-T">’</span>s also an ordinary target, but her quality, so to speak, is on a whole different level from Usami<span class="S-T">’</span>s! If Usami was orange juice, Tsukimori would be wine.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Then don<span class="S-T">’</span>t you agree that orange juice suits us minors?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No, you idiot, you don<span class="S-T">’</span>t get it. I<span class="S-T">’</span>m talking about the, um, well, that certain appeal of alcohol because you actually shouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t drink it, you know? Like, you<span class="S-T">’</span>re curious about the forbidden world that opens there and<span class="S-T">…</span>are you following me?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">certainly</span> <span class="S-T3">know</span> <span class="S-T3">what</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">mean.</span> <span class="S-T3">But</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T4">I</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">still</span> <span class="S-T3">like</span> <span class="S-T3">orange</span> <span class="S-T3">juice.</span> <span class="S-T3">Don</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">you?</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Um, well, sure, I like orange juice too, but<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Kamogawa<span class="S-T">’</span>s guys-alliance grumbled and contorted their faces.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">While Tsukimori was an exceptional girl indeed, Usami was very charming, too <span class="S-T">—</span> for an ordinary girl. Their reaction originated from not wanting to admit that I was right while being unable to deny it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Feeling like the winner, I said, <span class="S-T">“</span>Let<span class="S-T">’</span>s toast with some orange juice and wine, then.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">You could say I tasted the <span class="S-T">“</span>splendid wine of victory.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You<span class="S-T">’</span>re a pretty damn devious guy, you know that?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Thank you.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I ain<span class="S-T">’</span>t praising you.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Kamogawa was still a little sour, but I had succeeded in getting the air out of him.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>Hey, boys! Get back to your seats! Afternoon classes are starting!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Driven by this sudden voice, the guys turned their eyes towards the clock at once. They reacted that sensitively because the warning came from the girl they were just talking about.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>She<span class="S-T">’</span>s right. Let’s follow the advice of Orange Juice and wait at our seats,<span class="S-T">”</span> said Kamogawa, whereupon everyone returned to their respective desks.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Orange Juice<span class="S-T">…</span>?<span class="S-T">”</span> wondered Orange Juice a.k.a. Chizuru Usami and tilted her round head. <span class="S-T">“…</span>I bet you<span class="S-T">’</span>ve been talking bad about me or something, haven<span class="S-T">’</span>t you?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami, sitting beside me, pursed her lips.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>We were merely talking about beverages.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>That<span class="S-T">’</span>s a lie. If a couple of boys gather, they talk about either perverted or idiotic stuff,<span class="S-T">”</span> she claimed.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">That was a fairly unfair preconception, I had to say. Unfortunately though, I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t deny it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>what kind of tragic life have you gone through, Usami? I<span class="S-T">’</span>ve just become quite worried about you.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Don<span class="S-T">’</span>t pity me, Nonomiya! Idiot. I<span class="S-T">’</span>m normal! Your average high school girl!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami always got all worked up in no time whenever I teased her. And once she was worked up, she was like a little animal <span class="S-T">—</span> pretty amusing to watch, really.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Listen, you should visit a hospital before it<span class="S-T">’</span>s too late. If it<span class="S-T">’</span>s too embarrassing to go alone, I can also accompany you there, but<span class="S-T">—”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>I won<span class="S-T">’</span>t! Stop looking at me with those commiserating eyes!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She pushed my peeking head away with her palm: <span class="S-T">“</span>Go away!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Rejoice, Usami. It seems Nonomiya is fond of orange juice!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Kamogawa, who had been watching us, laughed with a face that made him seem like he<span class="S-T">’</span>d only talk about perverted or idiotic stuff.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Tell me already, what<span class="S-T">’</span>s the thing with that orange jui<span class="S-T">—”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami swallowed her words mid-sentence. Our math teacher, Kumada, had entered the classroom.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The only sounds in the classroom were Kumada<span class="S-T">’</span>s weak voice and the chalk hitting the blackboard.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Apparently our conversation was still bothering Usami; she kept stealing glances at me.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After some minutes had passed, she finally lost patience. She leaned her upper body a little towards me and whispered, <span class="S-T">“</span>What was that about?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m trying to concentrate on the lesson, Usami-san,<span class="S-T">”</span> I answered without removing my eyes from the blackboard.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>don<span class="S-T">’</span>t be mean~<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Because I kept silent, she started poking my side with her mechanical pencil. The tip pierced through the fabric of my uniform and stuck into my skin.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Hey, that hurts.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Then don<span class="S-T">’</span>t ignore me,<span class="S-T">”</span> sulked Usami. <span class="S-T">“</span>During lunch break, you boys were talking about Yōko-san, weren<span class="S-T">’</span>t you?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Oh, were we?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>you always try to slip off like this, Nonomiya. Actually, I know that you were gossiping about her!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">You</span> <span class="S-T3">eavesdropped</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">us?</span> <span class="S-T3">I’</span><span class="S-T3">m</span> <span class="S-T3">shocked.</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>That<span class="S-T">’</span>s not it! I only heard Yōko-san<span class="S-T">’</span>s name by chance! Because you boys were talking so loudly!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Usami,</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">called</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">attention</span> <span class="S-T3">because</span> <span class="S-T3">Kumada</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">turned</span> <span class="S-T3">towards</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">class.</span> <span class="S-T3">She</span> <span class="S-T3">sat</span> <span class="S-T3">up</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">hurry</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">pretended</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">copying</span> <span class="S-T3">what</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">writte</span><span class="S-T3">n</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">blackboard.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After some moments of silence: <span class="S-T">“…</span>Say, Nonomiya. You prefer girls like Yōko-san too, don<span class="S-T">’</span>t you?<span class="S-T">”</span> muttered Usami while looking down at her notes.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">glanced</span> <span class="S-T3">towards</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">front</span> <span class="S-T3">right.</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">girl</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">question</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">stared</span> <span class="S-T3">charismatical</span><span class="S-T3">ly</span> <span class="S-T3">at</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">blackboard.</span> <span class="S-T3">From</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">side</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">face</span> <span class="S-T3">looked</span> <span class="S-T3">intelligent,</span> <span class="S-T3">giving</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">little</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">feel</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">anchorwoman</span> <span class="S-T3">from</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">news.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Sitting in the very middle of the room, her outstanding aura made it feel as though she were the heart of the classroom.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Indeed, she was someone special. Although I personally avoided excessive contact with her, I could very well comprehend why everyone seemed to adore her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>No, not particularly.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t like trouble, but I became interested in how Usami would react.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Is that so?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She made a smile, seeming somehow relieved.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>We discussed this allegory: if she were a beverage, Tsukimori would be wine.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">—</span>What kind of reaction is she going to show me, I wonder?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>And, by the way, you<span class="S-T">’</span>d be orange juice.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Beside me I heard the sound of a pencil lead breaking.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Ah yeah?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami played with the pencil between her fingers, feigning indifference. However, I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t overlook that moment when her cheeks blushed.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After that Usami<span class="S-T">’</span>s questioning stopped.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her honest reaction had something that calmed my mind. I had only given her name back then to put them off, but perhaps I had actually revealed my true thoughts which I had been unaware of myself.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">At least at that very moment I felt that I liked Usami.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>by the way.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I considered our conversation finished, but she still wanted to say something it seemed.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami whispered with a serious expression on her face, <span class="S-T">“</span>I-I<span class="S-T">’</span>m normal, you know? A normal girl! Not some strange girl like you assumed earlier! I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t want to be misunderstood, okay?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I accidentally smiled because of Usami’s lovely words.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her honesty was very comfortable to me<span class="S-T">—</span>almost like tasting a glass of delicious orange juice.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I wished I could fall in love with her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After the monthly class officers<span class="S-T">’</span> regular meeting I watched the female officer of my class leave in a hurry and strolled back to our classroom.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Having</span> <span class="S-T3">reached</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">empty</span> <span class="S-T3">room,</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">prepared</span> <span class="S-T3">myself</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">leave</span> <span class="S-T3">as</span> <span class="S-T3">well.</span> <span class="S-T3">As</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">no</span> <span class="S-T3">club,</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">nothing</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">do</span> <span class="S-T3">at</span> <span class="S-T3">school</span> <span class="S-T3">anymore.</span> <span class="S-T3">What</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">left</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">going</span> <span class="S-T3">home</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">preparing</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">part-time</span> <span class="S-T3">j</span><span class="S-T3">ob.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">When</span> I stood up from my seat, I noticed a university notebook on the floor. I immediately noticed whom it belonged to. Its front page read <span class="S-T">“</span>Yōko Tsukimori<span class="S-T">”</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I looked around the room, but she wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t there. I decided to put it on her desk before leaving.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">But</span> just when I was about to do so, I registered a scrap of paper that peeked out from the notebook. I grasped the scrap, thinking nothing of it, and pulled it out.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>now that<span class="S-T">’</span>s unexpected,<span class="S-T">”</span> I unintentionally let out.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It turned out to be a folded A4 report sheet. The caption written on it matched neither the Tsukimori everyone talked of nor my personal image of her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After making sure nobody was watching, I stowed it away in my bag. I did so because I presumed it would take quite some time to read all of the tightly-written text.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">You could say I succumbed to temptation.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">No, at that very moment I felt not even a speck of guilt whatsoever. It was but pure curiosity.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t have anything against wine. To begin with, I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t possibly judge without ever having taken a sip. It<span class="S-T">’</span>s just that my attachment to the familiar drink won over my wariness of the unfamiliar one.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">In short, I was interested in the wine everyone praised so highly.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Alright, what kind of secret of our idol is going to come to light<span class="S-T">…</span>?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I left the classroom as I always did.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">It</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">past</span> <span class="S-T3">10</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T5">p.m.</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">when</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">returned</span> <span class="S-T3">home</span> <span class="S-T3">after</span> <span class="S-T3">finishing</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">work</span> <span class="S-T3">at</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">café.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">When I arrived there I had completely forgotten about the sheet. I had been looking forward to reading its contents, but the various stimuli at the café drove its existence into a corner of my memory.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I like to observe people. You might even call it my hobby.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Part of the reason why I chose to work at a café was surely that I simply like coffee, but more than that I found the different types of people you meet there interesting.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">A young woman who always takes the same seat and just keeps gazing outside. A man in the prime of his life who changes the girl at his side each visit. The cooled-down relationship of a couple that had been deeply in love just half a year ago. And many more.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It was something that excited my imagination<span class="S-T">—</span>a favorite pastime of mine.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">In reality though, I was no different from Kamogawa and the others. I, too, was just an ordinary 17-year-old teenager. I did not want to know the truth. I simply wanted to enjoy wallowing in my fantasies.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was in the middle of relaxing, taking a warm bath, when I remembered the sheet I had picked up after school.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">With my body still warm I dove onto my bed and unfolded the paper. While holding myself back from hurrying things, I slowly glanced over the title.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>The Murder Recipe<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I felt like I was reading the mystery novel of some popular author. Maybe this was due to the title actually sounding like a novel<span class="S-T">’</span>s.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">A</span> <span class="S-T3">scrap</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">paper</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">appeared</span> <span class="S-T3">from</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">no</span><span class="S-T3">tebook</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">person</span> <span class="S-T3">who</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">everyone</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span> <span class="S-T3">lips</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">There seemed to be no end to the rumors dealing with her vivid love life, but her image still remained mostly irreproachable. She was by no means a girl the word <span class="S-T">“</span>murder<span class="S-T">”</span> would have suited.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Pe</span><span class="S-T3">rhaps</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">this</span> <span class="S-T3">fact</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">piqued</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">curiosity.</span> <span class="S-T3">Contrasts</span> <span class="S-T3">like</span> <span class="S-T3">this</span> <span class="S-T3">have</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">sort</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">magic</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">them</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">sucks</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">good</span> <span class="S-T3">or</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">bad.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">My gaze skimmed over the text, completely absorbed by it. Faithful to its title <span class="S-T">“</span>The Murder Recipe<span class="S-T">”</span>, it introduced different ways of killing someone.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I noticed that parts of the text had been erased and corrected, indicating that the recipe had been revised several times. I could virtually sense the breath of the person who wrote down these rather messy characters. It had something vivid to it, so to speak.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">While reading on, I discovered something that all of the approaches had in common.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The most important objective appeared to be eliminating the target without getting one<span class="S-T">’</span>s own hands dirty. It was not a text written by a human who is fond of killing<span class="S-T">—</span>who sets the act of killing as his highest objective.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>is she really aiming to become a mystery author?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">These seemed exactly like tricks made for a mystery story. However, they were written rather clumsily and were far from perfect.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">To</span> <span class="S-T3">present</span> <span class="S-T3">an</span> <span class="S-T3">example:</span> <span class="S-T3">there</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">one</span> <span class="S-T3">way</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">killing</span> <span class="S-T3">titled</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">The</span> <span class="S-T3">Feigned</span> <span class="S-T3">Traffic</span> <span class="S-T3">Accident</span> <span class="S-T3">Murder</span> <span class="S-T3">Recipe</span><span class="S-T3">”</span><span class="S-T3">.</span> <span class="S-T3">The</span> <span class="S-T3">content</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">most</span> <span class="S-T3">simple.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul class="WW8Num">
    <li class="calibre5">
      <p class="P-P9"><span class="S-T">On</span> a road over a steep mountain pass.</p>

  </ul>

  <ul class="WW8Num">
    <li class="calibre5">
      <p class="P-P10"><span class="S-T">Disturb</span> the driver somehow.</p>

  <ul class="WW8Num">
    <li class="calibre5">
      <p class="P-P10"><span class="S-T">Make</span> him lose control of the steering wheel.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="P-P7">It was written in bullet points like this. Additional remarks like <span class="S-T">“</span>Phone the driver in order to make him lose concentration?<span class="S-T">”</span> or <span class="S-T">“</span>Put some hindrance on the road?<span class="S-T">”</span> were very sparsely added.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As can be seen, the grade of completion was very low. Maybe she was still in the stage of collecting together various ideas, trying to perfect it?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The risk was reduced to a minimum, but I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t think the plan was likely to succeed either. I could see she tried, but this was one weak plan if she was to really kill someone.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I dropped the murder recipe onto my desk.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Having had high expectations, the letdown was great. The all too childish contents of the recipe had killed my interest.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>This just spoiled my after-bath-bliss.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">After</span> <span class="S-T3">complaining</span> <span class="S-T3">aloud,</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">reached</span> <span class="S-T3">out</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">bookshelf</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">remove</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">bad</span> <span class="S-T3">taste</span> <span class="S-T3">by</span> <span class="S-T3">reading</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">real</span> <span class="S-T3">mystery</span> <span class="S-T3">novel.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>no, hold on a sec.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, I stopped my hand and started thinking. A new thought lifted my spirits to new heights again.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Who was the owner of this <span class="S-T">“</span>Murder Recipe<span class="S-T">”</span>?</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">It</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsuki</span><span class="S-T3">mori!</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">What</span> if, purely hypothetically, she had written this because she seriously wanted to kill someone<span class="S-T">…</span>? That thought made the clumsy text feel rather realistic at once.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Leaving aside the reason for now, there was a person whom Tsukimori wanted to die and she had desperately written a murder plan to make it happen.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T4">Tsukimori</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">had!</span> <span class="S-T3">That</span> <span class="S-T3">perfect,</span> <span class="S-T3">stylish,</span> <span class="S-T3">beautiful,</span> <span class="S-T3">intelligent</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">who</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">adored</span> <span class="S-T3">by</span> <span class="S-T3">everyone!</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">And she had edited such an immature murder plan over and over.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>now, aren<span class="S-T">’</span>t we cute?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">If this guess turned out to be true, I<span class="S-T">’</span>d almost become a big fan of hers.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">My imagination was put in motion. I started puzzling over all kinds of questions, like the person she wanted to kill, her potential motive and her hidden personality. I kept playing this game until the sky started to dawn in the east.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The next morning I went to school later than I usually did.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">By the time I entered the classroom, most of my classmates were already present. Of course, Tsukimori was among them as well.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">While walking to my seat, I secretly glanced at her. She was putting the things in her desk in order. At least to others it looked like such a perfectly normal action.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Not to me.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Good morning, Tsukimori.<span class="S-T">”</span> I greeted her as always.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She stopped peeking into her desk, tilted her head and looked at me while using her little finger to brush her elegant, long hair out of her face. <span class="S-T">“</span>Good morning, Nonomiya-kun.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She showed me her mature smile as always.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usually, our conversation would have ended right there. We knew each other only well enough to exchange greetings.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Are you looking for something?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, that morning I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t want to let it end there. My curiosity was vexing me, for I suspected that she might be searching for the <span class="S-T">“</span>Murder Recipe<span class="S-T">”</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I intensively stared at her, not wanting to miss the slightest stir.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No, I am just sorting my desk.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Sadly, her smile was left unchanged.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I told her, <span class="S-T">“</span>I see,<span class="S-T">”</span> and headed to my own seat, while thinking to myself that reality was so boring compared to imagination.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But<span class="S-T">…</span>,<span class="S-T">”</span> she suddenly called me from behind, <span class="S-T">“</span>why did you think I was searching for something?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was desperate not to break into a broad smile.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It was a feeling as though prey had hopped readily into my trap. Whatever her sentiments were, I started getting in high spirits just by the expectation of some amusing developments.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No, I<span class="S-T">’</span>m afraid there<span class="S-T">’</span>s no particular reason,<span class="S-T">”</span> I turned around towards her, playing dumb. <span class="S-T">“</span>But let me return that question: why do you ask?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I decided to probe lightly.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I had no particular reason, either.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I see.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Before me was only her unchanged mature smile. I felt the desire to make that smile freeze, but I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t intend to get to the core just yet. I thought it was best to keep my trump card for the very end.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But if<span class="S-T">…</span>,<span class="S-T">”</span> I began, <span class="S-T">“</span>if you are troubled, feel free to ask me for help.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>What<span class="S-T">’</span>s the matter, Nonomiya-kun? I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t remember you being this gentle?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m gentler than you believe, that<span class="S-T">’</span>s for sure.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I beg your pardon. I<span class="S-T">’</span>ll be sure to remember that then.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Of course the primary motivation would be getting a girl of outstanding popularity like you indebted to me, though.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori giggled.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Thank you. I will directly consult you then, Nonomiya-kun, should I ever be troubled.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori smiled with her almond eyes half closed.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">It</span> <span class="S-T3">didn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">look</span> <span class="S-T3">like</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T4">wasn</span><span class="S-T4">’</span><span class="S-T4">t</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">scheming</span> <span class="S-T3">something.</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">won</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">deny</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">influence</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">wishful</span> <span class="S-T3">thinking</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">this</span> <span class="S-T3">assessment,</span> <span class="S-T3">though.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Our conversation ended because our class teacher, Ukai, had appeared in the classroom.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">My mood was quite good that day. Kamogawa and his comrades were annoying when they came to question me about my conversation with Tsukimori in the following break, but I considered it a good harvest because I had discovered how thrilling and amusing it was to talk to her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Well, it was just me savoring the thrill produced by my own fantasies, though.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Still, it was much better than a boring reality.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Without any progress or new information, my peaceful daily routine went on and, before I knew it, two weeks had passed since finding the murder recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As there wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t anything to stir up my imagination, my excitement subsided and I was about to forget the very existence of the recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Because I had kept holding back my trump card, the game had stopped slowly and quietly. It was a truly pathetic situation.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, a change occurred all of a sudden.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Perhaps<span class="S-T">…</span>the game had not even started yet.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I went to school as always, and the classroom was ever noisy. But Tsukimori was nowhere in sight. Her seat was empty.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was puzzled, but the answer wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t long in coming.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Hey, Nonomiya! Have you heard?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It was Kamogawa.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Can<span class="S-T">’</span>t say I have.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Of course I had no idea what he was talking about because his sentence lacked the object.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Someone from Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s family is dead.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I felt my heartbeat accelerate.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Who?<span class="S-T">”</span> I asked while suppressing the arising excitement.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Her dad, it seems. It was a traffic accident. Yōko-san has my fullest sympathies<span class="S-T">…</span>,<span class="S-T">”</span> answered Usami with a sad face.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Really, I feel sorry for her. To lose one<span class="S-T">’</span>s father at this age, that<span class="S-T">’</span>s<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Unlike</span> <span class="S-T3">his</span> <span class="S-T3">usual</span> <span class="S-T3">behavior,</span> <span class="S-T3">even</span> <span class="S-T3">Kamogawa</span> <span class="S-T3">showed</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">mournful</span> <span class="S-T3">mien.</span> <span class="S-T3">That</span> <span class="S-T3">must</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">normal</span> <span class="S-T3">reaction.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>Indeed. Let<span class="S-T">’</span>s all support her.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, I harbored different emotions from the others. Yōko Tsukimori, traffic accident, death<span class="S-T">—</span>these keywords led me straight to the murder recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">desperately</span> <span class="S-T3">suppressed</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">grin</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">about</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">flash</span> <span class="S-T3">over</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">face.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P11"><span class="S-T">It</span><span class="S-T">’</span>s getting interesting.</p>

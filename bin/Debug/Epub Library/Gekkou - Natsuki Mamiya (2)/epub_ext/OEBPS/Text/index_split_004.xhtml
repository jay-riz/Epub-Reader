  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Two</span> <span class="S-T3">days</span> <span class="S-T3">later,</span> <span class="S-T3">when</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">came</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">school</span> <span class="S-T3">again,</span> <span class="S-T3">even</span> <span class="S-T3">students</span> <span class="S-T3">from</span> <span class="S-T3">other</span> <span class="S-T3">classes</span> <span class="S-T3">came</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">crowds</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">our</span> <span class="S-T3">classroom</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">catch</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">glimpse</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span><span class="S-T3">.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">One</span> after another they expressed their condolences, showing nothing but expressions of pity.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Kamogawa<span class="S-T">’</span>s voice could be heard from the human ring that had formed around the center of the room.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>School without you is like a night without the moon! Please Tsukimori, cheer up and light my footsteps in the dark as tenderly as you used to do!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Oh how I would love to see him stumble in the dark and get stuck in a gutter.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">A group of guys, Kamogawa among them, were trying to appear appealing, talking wildly to her. Taking advantage of a girl<span class="S-T">’</span>s weakness might be a usual and practical strategy, but I just couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t endure watching their pathetic and honorless behavior.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You’re quite the poet, aren<span class="S-T">’</span>t you Kamogawa-kun? Thank you for worrying about me.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, Tsukimori dealt with each of them with utmost politeness, not showing the slightest frown<span class="S-T">—</span>no, even smiling. Once again I came to understand why she was so popular.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Most people wouldn’t be able to behave as she did. At least I wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t have been able to. After all, I was already annoyed and I was just watching her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As soon as the wave of visitors broke off, Tsukimori stood up and, for some reason, headed towards me with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>It<span class="S-T">’</span>s quite unusual for you to approach me spontaneously.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But you came to my father<span class="S-T">’</span>s funeral, didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t you? I wanted to say thanks.<span class="S-T">”</span> She sat down on Usami<span class="S-T">’</span>s empty chair and smiled cheerfully at me. <span class="S-T">“</span>So, thanks for coming, Nonomiya-kun.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No, it<span class="S-T">’</span>s nothing that would deserve your appreciation. I merely attended as a representative for the class.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But it is. I was somehow relieved at seeing you being as laid-back as usual.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Oh, I<span class="S-T">’</span>m sorry for being such a cold-hearted guy. I was worried about you in my own way, though, you know? Too bad you didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t notice,<span class="S-T">”</span> I said and shrugged uncomfortably, whereupon Tsukimori laughed cheerfully: <span class="S-T">“</span>I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t think of you like that!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Have things settled down at home?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>There are still a lot of things that need to be taken care of, but for the time being, yes.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I see. You must have experienced some troublesome days, I guess. Well, school must have its troublesome aspects too, for someone as popular as you.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori shook her head, making her soft hair sway.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I am very grateful that everyone is so worried about me.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>It<span class="S-T">’</span>s nice when others feel concerned about you, indeed, but there are limits that have to be respected, right? Aren<span class="S-T">’</span>t those fanatic fans of yours a bother? Especially Kamogawa. Or Kamogawa.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m actually quite fond of that cute side of boys.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I tried to find out her true thoughts by agitating her, but Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s smile remained unchanged like an iron wall.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Your mature behavior is remarkable.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I am happy that you view me like that, Nonomiya-kun.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She accepted even my rather baffled words with a happy tone.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>Nonomiya-kun,<span class="S-T">”</span> Tsukimori said my name all of a sudden, <span class="S-T">“</span>do you remember your promise?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>Promise?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t remember ever making a promise to her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>If I<span class="S-T">’</span>m troubled<span class="S-T">—”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>Ah, I see.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">In the midst of her reminding me, I recalled a certain conversation I had with her one morning.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Right, that promise.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Well, I promised indeed. Ask for whatever you like, as long as I can help you with it.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It was a seed I had sowed myself, but deep in my heart I hoped that she would not have a bothersome request.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>It is something I would rather not talk about in the classroom,<span class="S-T">”</span> explained Tsukimori with a subdued voice so faint that no one else other than me could hear her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The next instant, I was tense from tip to toe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>ll be waiting for you in the library after school,<span class="S-T">”</span> she whispered and left the classroom elegantly with her hair streaming out behind her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The palm of my hand was drenched in sweat. Apparently, I was more tense than I had thought.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her suspicious attitude had instantly reminded me of the murder recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I sensed curiosity rising in me and hoped to get to the core of this affair at last. But at the same time, I was also alarmed because nobody, naturally including Tsukimori, should have known that the murder recipe was in my hands. My tension was proof that wariness exceeded curiosity, I suppose.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>What if Tsukimori knows that I have her murder recipe<span class="S-T">…</span>?<span class="S-T">”</span> I thought to myself, picturing an unhappy scenario.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her father’s funeral had been conducted without incident; she had become a character akin to the heroine of some dramatic play and was on everybody<span class="S-T">’</span>s lips. Could one of her plans possibly fail in the first place? Looking at how she had everything, that was the impression I got.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The only two things that were in her way were the murder recipe that had gone lost and I, since I knew what was written in it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As soon as she got rid of these two unsafe elements, she would have conducted the perfect crime and obtain her own <span class="S-T">“</span>ideal world<span class="S-T">”</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">…</span>perhaps she was planning on killing me in due time.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I gulped and my heartbeat got faster.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">And then<span class="S-T">—</span>I laughed.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t want to die. And I also had to admit that it was quite an absurd thought, but: I was intrigued. I was intrigued by how she would hunt me down.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">Where</span> else in my environment could I find such a stimulus? Furthermore, the opponent was Yōko Tsukimori<span class="S-T">—</span>I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t have wished for anyone better.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was convinced: this was the best time I<span class="S-T">’</span>d had in the seventeen years of my life so far.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">took</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">deep</span> <span class="S-T3">breat</span><span class="S-T3">h</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">stepped</span> <span class="S-T3">into</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">library.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The room was filled with the scent of paper as dry as fallen leaves. It was not a smell I disliked. At other times, I might have started leisurely browsing the library, but not now.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Even though I was moving leisurely, my eyes were restlessly searching for Tsukimori.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">And before long, I found her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She was sitting further inside at a desk for studying, reading a book with an elegant cover.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As classes had already ended and this was a library, it was already silent anyway, but that silence was even stronger around Tsukimori, as if I had entered a different realm.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Bewitched by her pure appearance that made her hard to approach, I just stood there holding my breath for a while.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her long-lashed eyes closed and opened softly as she blinked, and from time to time she led her hand to the edge of the page and smoothly turned to the next one. Her profile looked like the finest glass work, though definitely not created by man but a miracle brought forth by god. <span class="S-T">“</span>I would be a rich man if I could cut out this scene and frame it,<span class="S-T">”</span> I thought.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I confirmed that nobody was there except for Tsukimori and me.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Once</span> <span class="S-T3">again,</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">m</span> <span class="S-T3">sure</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">recent</span> <span class="S-T3">days</span> <span class="S-T3">have</span> <span class="S-T3">been</span> <span class="S-T3">hard</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">,</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">leaned</span> <span class="S-T3">against</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">book</span> <span class="S-T3">shelf</span> <span class="S-T3">as</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">addressed</span> <span class="S-T3">her,</span> <span class="S-T3">“—</span><span class="S-T3">losing</span> <span class="S-T3">your</span> <span class="S-T3">father</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">an</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T4">accident</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">all.</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori clapped her book shut and slowly turned towards me.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Yes, especially for my mother. I have never seen her that down-hearted.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She gave a weak, tired laugh.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>How about you?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m sorry, but I have not recovered enough to talk about it yet.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori shook her head with a troubled mien. It was a rather noncommittal answer.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No, it was a rude question on my part. I beg your pardon.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I bowed my head.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>By the way, what is your request?<span class="S-T">”</span> I brought up the main topic after a breath, <span class="S-T">“</span>You specially called me out to the library for this, so I should think it<span class="S-T">’</span>s something quite delicate?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You told me to ask for your help if I am troubled.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Yeah, and you answered that you would consult me directly.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Exactly. That<span class="S-T">’</span>s why I would like to get back to your offer, Nonomiya-kun. Please lend me a hand.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Then she spoke as if humming a tune:</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I want you to go out with me.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her completely unexpected words made my mind go blank.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">To be sure I chose to ask, <span class="S-T">“</span>Where to?<span class="S-T">”</span> but Tsukimori only bewilderedly replied: <span class="S-T">“</span>You aren<span class="S-T">’</span>t funny,<span class="S-T">”</span> and shook her neat chin left and right.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I suppose I<span class="S-T">’</span>m not the person to criticize you, having already asked a tactless question just earlier, but you do realize that you lost your father only some days ago?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  </div>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">Unlike</span> Tsukimori I had to feign composure; I was observing all of her movements with the greatest attention in order to read her intentions while my brain ran full throttle.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Do you want to say I am imprudent?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>If you talk in extremes, yes.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Then you misunderstand me! Precisely because my father has passed away, I thought that I<span class="S-T">’</span>d need someone for support. Isn<span class="S-T">’</span>t it romantic if you call it <span class="S-T">‘</span>the support of my heart<span class="S-T">’</span>? I am not as strong as everyone believes, you know?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Indeed, this was a good reason, but there were still too many points that didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t match.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Then, why does it have to be me? I fail to understand why a popular girl like you would choose someone like me.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori giggled, <span class="S-T">“</span>I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t know you were so gauche, Nonomiya-kun. It seems you don<span class="S-T">’</span>t understand a woman<span class="S-T">’</span>s heart at all if you ask for a reason why she confessed.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I found her attitude a little irritating.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But you don<span class="S-T">’</span>t seem to understand a man<span class="S-T">’</span>s heart at all, either. At least I<span class="S-T">’</span>m not so simple as to have no doubts whatsoever when a beauty asks me to go out with her all of a sudden. There<span class="S-T">’</span>s always a catch to attractive deals, isn<span class="S-T">’</span>t there?<span class="S-T">”</span> I sneered at her as payback.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Is that so? I was sure that boys never feel bad being confessed to by a girl?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The certainty in her tone made me lose my words for a moment.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Indeed<span class="S-T">…</span>we are simple enough to be happy about it, but the reply is a different matter.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t want to admit it, but she was right. I unintentionally prided myself on the confession that everyone would envy me for. Was it the difference in our experience points? My chances were awfully worse when it came to love.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Is there a girl you are fond of, Nonomiya-kun?<span class="S-T">”</span> Tsukimori suddenly asked<span class="S-T">—</span>as easily as a waitress who confirms a customer<span class="S-T">’</span>s order.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>There isn<span class="S-T">’</span>t.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami<span class="S-T">’</span>s face came to mind for a split second, but I neither liked her enough to mention her distinctly, nor was I straightforward enough to answer honestly.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Is there a girl you are going out with, then?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>isn<span class="S-T">’</span>t the order of questions a bit awry? Usually it would be the other way around, wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t it?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Is that so? Maybe you are going out with someone you don<span class="S-T">’</span>t love?<span class="S-T">”</span> she answered with a wondering mien.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>I think I finally understand why the guys say that all the rumors about you might be true.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I shrugged over-exaggeratedly.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Those rumors are nothing but that, rumors, and you are not the type of person that is swayed by them, Nonomiya-kun.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>What makes you so sure? Even I watch my step if I hear some bad rumors, you know?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>If you want, I can tell you which of them are true and which are not? In return<span class="S-T">—”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>I hope you don<span class="S-T">’</span>t want to make dating the condition.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Our chemistry is right!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori showed no sign of timidity, instead she even smiled brightly.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>As if I<span class="S-T">’</span>d ever accept such an unfair condition!<span class="S-T">”</span> This time it was me who was taken aback. <span class="S-T">“…</span>I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t know you were this kind of girl.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She made me dance to her tune from start to finish. All the possible replies I had simulated in advance for this conversation were going to waste one after another.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>This is my way of paying respect to you, Nonomiya-kun! You are the person I wish to go out with. I think there is no point in showing you only a superficial side.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m sorry about your respect, but haven<span class="S-T">’</span>t you thought about the possibility that I might refuse?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I am ready to accept some amount of damage in order to obtain what I want. If you are afraid of getting hurt, you won<span class="S-T">’</span>t obtain what you really desire. Well, revealing a few of my cards does not even count as damage anyway.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Exceptional self-confidence, indeed! No wonder that the girls of our grade add a <span class="S-T">‘</span>-san<span class="S-T">’</span> to your name.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t know you were such an uptight person either. I was rather sure you were the type to let things take their course.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m much more sensible than you may think. And a little contrary, too. And I<span class="S-T">’</span>m definitely not daring enough to get myself involved in affairs that make no sense to me or that I can’t agree to.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Aren<span class="S-T">’</span>t you just averse to doing things you are not interested in?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I won<span class="S-T">’</span>t deny that! At any rate, if I go out with you, I won<span class="S-T">’</span>t have my peace any more. I<span class="S-T">’</span>m simply not leading my life actively enough as to take to attracting attention, that<span class="S-T">’</span>s all.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>It<span class="S-T">’</span>s a shame that you are so stubborn, Nonomiya-kun<span class="S-T">…</span>,<span class="S-T">”</span> she said and fell silent.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">We shared a painful silence.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Even the shouts of the sports clubs from the grounds seemed loud inside the soundless library and I heard the rustling of her skirt all too clearly when Tsukimori crossed her slender legs the other way around.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s gaze was listlessly wandering about in the air, hesitating about something.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Even such trivial gestures looked like a scene of a movie, sweetening the time until her next words and keeping me from getting bored.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Then I saw her lips move calmly.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>if I tell you the reason why I chose you, will you be more open towards my request?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I gulped down. In my imagination she got straight to the point and proclaimed that the reason was that I had the murder recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Such an answer would naturally be quite absurd, but as Tsukimori seemed to be an unpredictable person, I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t deem it impossible any more. Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s hidden character was bold, determined, and outstandingly clever on top of it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">That was the kind of girl approaching me. I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t help but suspect some kind of catch in her request to go out with me.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>More than now,<span class="S-T">”</span> I replied, choosing my words carefully.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I had hardly finished speaking when she squinted one of her almond eyes and smiled mischievously.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Because I like your looks. It would be even better if you weren<span class="S-T">’</span>t a quibbler.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her reply caught me so flat-footed that I would have liked to fall on the floor, but I contained myself and launched a counterattack.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>What a coincidence. I also think you<span class="S-T">’</span>re not half-bad, save for your personality.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>We would make a well-matched couple then, wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t we?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>In the sense of awful, sure.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her constantly playing around with me had completely cooled me down.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">Suspecting</span> Yōko Tsukimori to be a <span class="S-T">“</span>father murderer<span class="S-T">”</span> suddenly felt terribly idiotic and embarrassing.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Indeed,</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">determined</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">bold</span> <span class="S-T3">girl,</span> <span class="S-T3">but</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">also</span> <span class="S-T3">knew</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">definitely</span> <span class="S-T3">not</span> <span class="S-T3">foolish.</span> <span class="S-T3">Even</span> <span class="S-T3">if</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">hypothetically</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">considered</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">father</span> <span class="S-T3">an</span> <span class="S-T3">eyesore,</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">would</span> <span class="S-T3">have</span> <span class="S-T3">found</span> <span class="S-T3">many</span> <span class="S-T3">other</span> <span class="S-T3">ways</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">getting</span> <span class="S-T3">rid</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">him</span> <span class="S-T3">without</span> <span class="S-T3">choosing</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">means</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">murder</span><span class="S-T3">”</span><span class="S-T3">.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">In the first place, could someone who had committed murder remain that composed? She was a peculiar girl, but I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t sense even a shred of shadiness or malicious emotion in her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Suddenly<span class="S-T">——</span>something touched my bangs. I reflexively jumped backward.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m sorry.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After taking a look, I noticed that Tsukimori had stood up from her chair and had stretched her smooth white fingers towards me.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Your hair looked so beautiful that I wanted to touch it very badly.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori gave me a bewitching smile, beautiful like the light of the moon.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">—</span>A shiver ran down my spine.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">To me, that girl didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t seem to be from the same world.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Please think about it seriously,<span class="S-T">”</span> Tsukimori said and moved toward the exit.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">While she passed me, her hair stroked my cheek and left behind a strong scent of roses.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">Even</span> though I had planned to learn more about her, I now understood Yōko Tsukimori even less than before.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Then I recalled how Kamogawa had compared her to wine.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Indeed.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was intoxicated by Yōko Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s fragrance.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">The</span> first lesson was English, but I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t remember anything of it. I was pondering the accident of Yōko Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s father.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">also</span> <span class="S-T3">played</span> <span class="S-T3">with</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">thought</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">browsing</span> <span class="S-T3">some</span> <span class="S-T3">news</span> <span class="S-T3">sites</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">mobile</span> <span class="S-T3">phone</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">hidden</span> <span class="S-T3">from</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">eyes</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">teacher,</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">course</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">but</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">decided</span> <span class="S-T3">against</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">because</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">known</span> <span class="S-T3">as</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">fairly</span> <span class="S-T3">well-behaving</span> <span class="S-T3">student.</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">kept</span> <span class="S-T3">telling</span> <span class="S-T3">myself</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">keeping</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">best</span> <span class="S-T3">for</span> <span class="S-T3">last</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">spent</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">painful</span> <span class="S-T3">hour</span> <span class="S-T3">like</span> <span class="S-T3">this.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The very moment the English lesson ended, I rushed out of the classroom, fired up for details about the accident, and headed straight to the library room.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It should have today<span class="S-T">’</span>s newspaper, and since there was a casualty, there had to be an article about it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">And just as I had expected, there was an article that dealt with the accident in question. I was a bit disappointed when I started reading; there was an article, sure, but it was a short one and written very briefly in a corner of the local news page.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, as I read on, my heartbeat became faster. In the text I found some of the keywords I was looking for.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>on his way home on a mountain pass<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>a sharp curve with poor sight distance<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>there have been casualties before<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>too much speed due to the slope<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">There</span> <span class="S-T3">were</span> <span class="S-T3">s</span><span class="S-T3">everal</span> <span class="S-T3">text</span> <span class="S-T3">passages</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">reminded</span> <span class="S-T3">me</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Feigned</span> <span class="S-T3">Traffic</span> <span class="S-T3">Accident</span> <span class="S-T3">Murder</span> <span class="S-T3">Recipe</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">as</span> <span class="S-T3">noted</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">murder</span> <span class="S-T3">recipe.</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">couldn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">help</span> <span class="S-T3">getting</span> <span class="S-T3">excited</span> <span class="S-T3">at</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">thought</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">executed</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">murder</span> <span class="S-T3">plan.</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">…</span><span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">also,</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">couldn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">help</span> <span class="S-T3">feeling</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">chi</span><span class="S-T3">ll</span> <span class="S-T3">run</span> <span class="S-T3">down</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">spine</span> <span class="S-T3">when</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">imagined</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">accident</span> <span class="S-T3">with</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">thought</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">mind.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Just as important were the unwritten facts.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The article wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t have been this tiny if the Police had considered the possibility of murder. Similarly, I wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t have remained oblivious until arriving at school.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Had I gotten something fatally wrong?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The plan looked childish at first glance, like an uncertain trick that relied on several shaky elements.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">But maybe she executed that plan exactly because of those flaws?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Who would presume the existence of such a clumsy murder plan?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Who would see a schemed murder in something that looked like nothing but an accident?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">And as the facts showed, the police were convinced that it was simply a traffic accident. The same applied to my classmates; everyone considered Tsukimori a poor girl who had lost her father in an accident.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I bet even the victim himself wouldn’t have dreamed of her being a murderer.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Nor would I have, if I hadn<span class="S-T">’</span>t known of the murder recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Probably it wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t even have been much of a problem if the plan had failed. It was based on luck anyway; if you look only at the probability, it was unlikely to succeed in the first place.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">But exactly that aspect was the point of the murder recipe.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">There were multiple plans written in it that were all dependent on random external circumstances. So wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t she expecting them to fail from the very beginning?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s target was her father<span class="S-T">—</span>someone who was always close to her and, hence, gave her countless opportunities to kill him. It may be a coarse expression, but you could say that <span class="S-T">“</span>even a bad shot hits the mark given enough tries.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori certainly did not intend to just pull it off as fast as possible. She merely wanted him to die sooner or later. I guess that<span class="S-T">’</span>s how she felt about it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She did not, however, want to get busted for it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I had noticed from the time I had first read the recipe that the plan was not designed chiefly for killing, but rather for living on normally after executing it.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">In that case, the results made it evident. Tsukimori had done it<span class="S-T">—</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">—</span>the perfect murder.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t help thinking so.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Of course, this was all just a product of my mind and far too baseless to be considered certain.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I knew her no better than my classmates. When it came to her, Kamogawa was actually much more knowledgeable than I. These thoughts were merely an extension to my usual <span class="S-T">“</span>imagine and enjoy<span class="S-T">”</span> pastime and not something upright like <span class="S-T">“</span>solving a case<span class="S-T">”</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, for some reason I just couldn’t call my guess a cheap delusion and call it quits.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The homeroom after that day<span class="S-T">’</span>s classes was about Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s father<span class="S-T">’</span>s death.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I think everyone knows of the passing of Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s father. A funeral is being held tomorrow afternoon, which I am going to attend. Thus, the fifth lesson, biology, is going to be self-study.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">When the word <span class="S-T">“</span>self-study<span class="S-T">”</span> left our class teacher Ukai<span class="S-T">’</span>s mouth, a wave of joy went through the ranks of my classmates.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Hey,</span> <span class="S-T3">that’s</span> <span class="S-T3">called</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T4">tactless,</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">know?</span> <span class="S-T3">Empathize</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">little</span> <span class="S-T3">with</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">who</span> <span class="S-T3">has</span> <span class="S-T3">just</span> <span class="S-T3">lost</span> <span class="S-T3">one</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">parents!</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">Ukai</span> <span class="S-T3">rebuked</span> <span class="S-T3">us</span><span class="S-T3">—</span><span class="S-T3">not</span> <span class="S-T3">with</span> <span class="S-T3">an</span> <span class="S-T3">especially</span> <span class="S-T3">strong</span> <span class="S-T3">tone,</span> <span class="S-T3">but</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">classroom</span> <span class="S-T3">became</span> <span class="S-T3">silent.</span> <span class="S-T3">It</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">heavy</span> <span class="S-T3">silence.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Apparently content with the unexpected contemplation of his students, he closed this matter.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Moreover, the class officers are required to come along to the funeral as the representatives of the class. I<span class="S-T">’</span>m counting on you. Okay, homeroom<span class="S-T">’</span>s closed.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Right</span> <span class="S-T3">when</span> <span class="S-T3">Ukai</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">about</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">finish:</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Sensei!</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">Usami</span> <span class="S-T3">raised</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">hand,</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">The</span> <span class="S-T3">female</span> <span class="S-T3">class</span> <span class="S-T3">officer</span> <span class="S-T3">is</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko</span> <span class="S-T3">herself.</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Aah, you<span class="S-T">’</span>re right. Well then, Usami, may I ask you?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Ah, yes.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>The other one was you, Nonomiya, right? I expect you to be there.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Yes.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I nodded calmly and secretly grinned to myself.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">It</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">exactly</span> <span class="S-T3">what</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">wished</span> <span class="S-T3">fo</span><span class="S-T3">r.</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">not</span> <span class="S-T3">even</span> <span class="S-T3">dreamed</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">would</span> <span class="S-T3">have</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">chance</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">attend</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">funeral</span> <span class="S-T3">officially</span> <span class="S-T3">like</span> <span class="S-T3">this.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Actually, after reading the article in the library I had pondered about how I might be able to go to the funeral, because I had wanted to obtain more information on Tsukimori. While I had reckoned that the ceremonies would be beyond reach, I had thought that I could at least attend the wake of the deceased.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Only the two of you?! That<span class="S-T">’</span>s not fair!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After making sure that Ukai had left, Kamogawa scowled alternately at Usami and me.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Who was the irresponsible guy that proposed me as the class officer at the beginning of the term again?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Just this once I was grateful for that irresponsible personality of his, though.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Dunno? I<span class="S-T">’</span>m a man who doesn<span class="S-T">’</span>t look back at times gone past.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Your irresponsibility deserves admiration. In a bad sense.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>It<span class="S-T">’</span>s an honor!!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I could only smile wryly at Kamogawa<span class="S-T">’</span>s haughty answer.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Kamogawa,</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">brute!</span> <span class="S-T3">Didn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">listen</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">Ukai-sensei?</span> <span class="S-T3">You</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">re</span> <span class="S-T3">being</span> <span class="S-T3">tactless</span><span class="S-T3">…”</span> <span class="S-T3">pouted</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">serious</span> <span class="S-T3">Usami</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">not</span><span class="S-T3">icing</span> <span class="S-T3">his</span> <span class="S-T3">easy-going</span> <span class="S-T3">attitude.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>This is a misunderstanding, Usami. I am merely worried about a fellow classmate who has lost a dear one, you know?<span class="S-T">”</span> Kamogawa assured us with a meek expression.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">That</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">lie.</span> <span class="S-T3">It</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">s</span> <span class="S-T3">clear</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">you</span> <span class="S-T3">only</span> <span class="S-T3">want</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">meet</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko-san</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span><span class="S-T3">cause</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">your</span> <span class="S-T3">ulterior</span> <span class="S-T3">motives!</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">claimed</span> <span class="S-T3">Usami.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>No, idiot! I would never have ulterior motives! I simply wish to soothe Tsukimori in these hard times,<span class="S-T">”</span> he objected instantly, <span class="S-T">“</span>Well, but sure, I would not be averse to her falling in love with me in the process, heh!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You really are a brute, Kamogawa!<span class="S-T">”</span> Usami seemed completely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As was I: <span class="S-T">“</span>Kamogawa, perk your ears: that<span class="S-T">’</span>s what we call an ulterior motive.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Ahaa, I see! You never stop learning, do you?<span class="S-T">”</span> Kamogawa evaded my remark with feigned ignorance. There<span class="S-T">’</span>s no cure for a Kamogawa.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>I hope you don<span class="S-T">’</span>t have an ulterior motive too, Nonomiya?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">She realized that Kamogawa was beyond hope and set me as her new target.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Of course not. I am going to the funeral ceremony because I<span class="S-T">’</span>m a class officer, not because I wish for it myself,<span class="S-T">”</span> I put on a powerless smile. <span class="S-T">“</span>Also, I don<span class="S-T">’</span>t like the gloomy air at funerals. To be honest, I would rather not go.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Right? I knew you weren<span class="S-T">’</span>t like Kamogawa!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami flashed a brilliant smile as if she herself had been praised.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Your attitudes towards me and Nonomiya are way too different! I sense discrimination! If I were from America, I would take you to court right now!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>But you<span class="S-T">’</span>re Japanese from head to toe. And it<span class="S-T">’</span>s the difference between your daily behaviors that distinguishes you from Nonomiya. Blame yourself?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">While of a completely different nature, I had an ulterior motive too. To tell the truth, I loved funerals. Especially because you could sneak a peek at all kinds of humans.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was looking forward to the next day<span class="S-T">’</span>s funeral with the same sentiments as going to a concert of my favorite artist.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">After ending the third lesson, Usami and I were brought to the funeral home in Ukai<span class="S-T">’</span>s car. There was not one cloud in the broad blue sky outside the window.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">During the ride I was able to gather some details about Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s family environment from Ukai.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her family consisted of her two parents and herself, their only child. This was actually quite surprising to me because her mature behavior had led me to believe that she<span class="S-T">’</span>d have someone to look after, such as a younger sibling.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Apparently her father had been the head of a construction design company. Since my own father worked at a bank near that company, I planned on asking him about it afterward.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As soon as we had arrived at the funeral home and had gone through the formalities at the entrance, we proceeded to the hall that was marked with a sign reading <span class="S-T">“</span>Tsukimori.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">A lot of flower offerings were being made, so that the line led out of the hall. It was as though I was watching the scene of an arcade that had installed a new game machine.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The dim, wide room was packed with people in mourning clothes. The altar seemed much more magnificent to me than the ones in any past funerals I had attended.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">We sat down in the seats that had been prepared for common attendants and waited patiently for the beginning of the ceremony.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">My eyes searched for Tsukimori and found her sitting near the altar where the relatives had gathered. She was comforting the woman beside her who hung her head, supporting her and stroking her back.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">From the looks of it, I suspected it could be her mother. She was a beautiful lady who resembled Tsukimori.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I was, however, surprised at how composed Tsukimori apparently was.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">It</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">then</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">recalled</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">once</span> <span class="S-T3">asked</span> <span class="S-T3">Usa</span><span class="S-T3">mi</span> <span class="S-T3">why</span> <span class="S-T3">all</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">girls</span> <span class="S-T3">called</span> <span class="S-T3">Tsukimori</span> <span class="S-T3">with</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">-san</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">added</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">name.</span> <span class="S-T3">Her</span> <span class="S-T3">answer</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">been:</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Yōko-san</span> <span class="S-T3">may</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">same</span> <span class="S-T3">age</span> <span class="S-T3">as</span> <span class="S-T3">us,</span> <span class="S-T3">but</span> <span class="S-T3">doesn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">she</span> <span class="S-T3">kind</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">look</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">behave</span> <span class="S-T3">very</span> <span class="S-T3">maturely?</span> <span class="S-T3">So</span> <span class="S-T3">basically,</span> <span class="S-T3">someone</span> <span class="S-T3">started</span> <span class="S-T3">calling</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">Yōko-san,</span> <span class="S-T3">which</span> <span class="S-T3">then</span> <span class="S-T3">led</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">th</span><span class="S-T3">e</span> <span class="S-T3">current</span> <span class="S-T3">state.</span><span class="S-T3">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Indeed. I was almost unsure of who the mother and who the daughter was.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>I<span class="S-T">’</span>m so sorry for Yōko-san.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">looked</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">my</span> <span class="S-T3">side</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">found</span> <span class="S-T3">Usami</span> <span class="S-T3">with</span> <span class="S-T3">watery</span> <span class="S-T3">eyes.</span> <span class="S-T3">She</span> <span class="S-T3">not</span> <span class="S-T3">only</span> <span class="S-T3">gave</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">feeling</span> <span class="S-T3">of</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">born</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">little</span> <span class="S-T3">sister,</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">but</span> <span class="S-T3">actually</span> <span class="S-T3">had</span> <span class="S-T3">an</span> <span class="S-T3">elder</span> <span class="S-T3">brother.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You<span class="S-T">’</span>re quite a sissy, aren<span class="S-T">’</span>t you?<span class="S-T">”</span> I said and produced a handkerchief.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Just look at how she<span class="S-T">’</span>s keeping calm though she<span class="S-T">’</span>s bound to be sad in reality! If it was me, I wouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t be able to<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami seized the handkerchief from my hands and rubbed her eyes with it. Certainly, Usami would probably cry her lungs out.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">But I was reluctant to agree with her that Tsukimori was saddened about her father<span class="S-T">’</span>s death.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">If I was right on Tsukimori wishing for his death<span class="S-T">…</span>then she was pleased rather than sorrowful, because in that case this funeral was actually an event to celebrate the success of her murder plan.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">As time went by, the seats of the hall gradually filled and before I knew it, the whole hall was painted black.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">From every direction I could hear whispers that had been lowered in respect of the solemn mood that accompanied funeral homes. I decided to listen attentively to that chattering as a combined means of killing time and gathering information.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I focused on the conversation of two women that were meekly talking in the row right before me. I would have loved to jot it down!</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Their chatter was interrupted midways. I would have preferred to listen a little longer, but there was no helping it since the ceremony had begun.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The sutra conducted by the priest resounded clearly throughout the hall.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The solemn mood set my mind at rest and thus produced the perfect environment for indulging myself in my thoughts. I chose to replay the conversation I had just heard in my mind and put the data in order:</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her father<span class="S-T">’</span>s reputation was extremely good.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">First they had talked about his looks, which wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t too surprising, considering he was Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s father. A glance at the picture on the altar showed that he had looked like some performer and made me comprehend why he was popular with them.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Then, they continued with his company<span class="S-T">’</span>s and his family<span class="S-T">’</span>s economic situation. While it was a S.M.E., the business went smoothly and their private living standard was quite high as well. Apparently, their home had been newly built two years ago, with a complex design as one would expect from the director of a construction design business.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Lastly, they had talked about his family itself. Both father and mother had been fairly sociable and on good terms with their neighbors. The women had also raised the subject of Tsukimori. She was valued as a beautiful daughter with good manners.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I let out a sigh.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Admittedly, I was happy that I could get my hands on new information, but there had been nothing that could ignite my fantasies. The newspaper had gotten me too excited and caused me to have too high expectations of the funeral.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I breathed in the silent air of the hall.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Pulling myself together, I decided to give myself over to the tranquil mood of the room again. It was a promising funeral, after all! It would be a waste not to take advantage of the occasion and spy on some human relationships.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">No need to rush things. The longer this game of ours lasted, the better.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">When I turned my gaze towards the area near the altar, I noticed that Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s mother had broken down in tears.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her wailing was apparently also the reason why the women in my surroundings provided me with a background of sobbing voices. By the way, Usami was still crying as well.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However, there were no tears in Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s eyes.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Her gaze was captivatingly fixed on the altar.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Because her black mourning dress emphasized the brightness of her skin, it almost seemed as though Tsukimori herself was gleaming. More than the deceased man himself, more than the richly decorated altar or the whining mother or everyone else in the room, it was Tsukimori and her silent appearance that stood out.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">To me, Tsukimori appeared like the moon late at night.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Stunningly beautiful.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">It was time for the coffin<span class="S-T">’</span>s departure. While sounding its loud and sober horn, the hearse departed before the eyes of the people in black.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The relatives of the deceased, Tsukimori among them, left the hall temporarily and headed to the crematory. The three of us decided that we would wait for her return so that we could at least exchange a few words with her.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You two must be hungry, right? Let me treat you to lunch today. But keep it a secret from the others, okay?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Yay! You hear this, Nonomiya?<span class="S-T">”</span> Usami rejoiced without any restraint. This must be one of those infamous mood swings.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Well, being fond of the word <span class="S-T">“</span>secret<span class="S-T">”</span>, I also gladly accepted his offer.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Moments later, we were slurping ramen in a shop near the funeral home.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“—</span>You two may not be quite aware of it yet, but death is an inescapable part of life,<span class="S-T">”</span> Ukai said suddenly, his glasses fogged by the steam of his soup. <span class="S-T">“</span>Saying this may be tactless towards Tsukimori, but still I would like you to treasure the impressions of this very uncommon and sad happening: the passing of a comrade<span class="S-T">’</span>s father.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami nodded earnestly, her mouth stuffed with noodles like a squirrel.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Indeed. I was reminded that there is a limit to our lives<span class="S-T">—</span>and also that this makes life all the more valuable.<span class="S-T">”</span> Being in my class teacher<span class="S-T">’</span>s company, I chose my words carefully when relaying my impressions.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>You<span class="S-T">’</span>re amazing, Nonomiya,<span class="S-T">”</span> Usami praised me with wide eyes after gulping down her noodles.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Of course. Unlike you, I wasn<span class="S-T">’</span>t crying all the way through the ceremony.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I-I had lots of thoughts crossing my mind, too!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>For instance?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Eh? Ah, um, that I<span class="S-T">’</span>m sorry for her<span class="S-T">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>What else?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“…</span>T-That I<span class="S-T">’</span>m sorry for her?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I heard that already.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>N-No, don<span class="S-T">’</span>t get me wrong! In truth I have been thinking about much more than this, it<span class="S-T">’</span>s just that I can<span class="S-T">’</span>t put it into words as well as you!<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Ukai laughed from listening to our conversation.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Well, well, let<span class="S-T">’</span>s settle down with the conclusion that both of you had your respective thoughts, okay? Nonomiya was more analytical and Usami more emotional.<span class="S-T">”</span> Ukai went between and solved it like a teacher.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">–</span>Life<span class="S-T">’</span>s interesting because there<span class="S-T">’</span>s a limit to it. The thrill of not knowing when it ends is what gives you the awareness of being alive.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">At first glance it might seem contradictory that death, the antithesis of life, highlights the value of life, but it actually makes sense. I even conceived the idea that most things in the world might work in a similar way.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">At that very moment, enthralled by the risky murder recipe<span class="S-T">—</span>I was most definitely living.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">We greeted Tsukimori when she came back to the hall.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Ukai first expressed his deepest sympathy before assuring her: <span class="S-T">“</span>Don<span class="S-T">’</span>t be concerned about school. Take your time and return when you<span class="S-T">’</span>re comfortable.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Thank you very much for your thoughtfulness. However, I have it in mind to attend school normally from the day after tomorrow because I think it will help me to distract myself.<span class="S-T">”</span> She smiled weakly. <span class="S-T">“…</span>I am a little anxious about leaving my mother alone at home, as she has been hit especially hard, but her siblings and my father’s siblings both assured me that they will be supporting her for a while.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori seemed exhausted. From the looks of it, she hadn<span class="S-T">’</span>t been sleeping properly.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">But</span> <span class="S-T3">while</span> <span class="S-T3">knowing</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">was</span> <span class="S-T3">pretty</span> <span class="S-T3">tactless,</span> <span class="S-T3">I</span> <span class="S-T3">couldn</span><span class="S-T3">’</span><span class="S-T3">t</span> <span class="S-T3">help</span> <span class="S-T3">being</span> <span class="S-T3">under</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">impression</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">white</span> <span class="S-T3">face,</span> <span class="S-T3">now</span> <span class="S-T3">accentuated</span> <span class="S-T3">by</span> <span class="S-T3">her</span> <span class="S-T3">mourning</span> <span class="S-T3">dress,</span> <span class="S-T3">looked</span> <span class="S-T3">even</span> <span class="S-T3">more</span> <span class="S-T3">sensual</span> <span class="S-T3">than</span> <span class="S-T3">at</span> <span class="S-T3">sc</span><span class="S-T3">hool.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I see. At any rate, be sure not to over-strain yourself and feel free to consult me anytime.<span class="S-T">”</span> Ukai patted her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Thank you for coming as well, Chizuru, Nonomiya-kun.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>Everyone in the class is worried about you.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">“</span>I feel blessed.<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Yō</span><span class="S-T3">ko-san</span><span class="S-T3">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami was on the verge of tears again, apparently moved by Tsukimori<span class="S-T">’</span>s brave behavior.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I poked her head and said: <span class="S-T">“</span>Shouldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t you calm down a bit? You wanted to express your condolences properly, right?<span class="S-T">”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">“…</span><span class="S-T3">Yeah,</span><span class="S-T3">”</span> <span class="S-T3">Usami</span> <span class="S-T3">nodded</span> <span class="S-T3">teary-eyed.</span> <span class="S-T3">“</span><span class="S-T3">Um</span><span class="S-T3">…</span><span class="S-T3">Yōko-s</span><span class="S-T3">an,</span> <span class="S-T3">it</span> <span class="S-T3">will</span> <span class="S-T3">be</span> <span class="S-T3">hard</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">you,</span> <span class="S-T3">but</span><span class="S-T3">…</span><span class="S-T3">i-it</span> <span class="S-T3">will</span> <span class="S-T3">whe</span> <span class="S-T3">hard</span> <span class="S-T3">on</span> <span class="S-T3">yhew,</span> <span class="S-T3">but</span><span class="S-T3">…”</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Usami began weeping mid-sentence because she couldn<span class="S-T">’</span>t bear it anymore.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Tsukimori didn<span class="S-T">’</span>t hesitate to embrace Usami<span class="S-T">’</span>s round head and comforted her, <span class="S-T">“</span>Thank you, Chizuru. I<span class="S-T">’</span>m very happy that you are so worried about me.<span class="S-T">”</span> While stroking her head like a loving sister, she murmured, <span class="S-T">“…</span>I think you can consider yourself happy if you have someone that worries about you.<span class="S-T">”</span> After that, she whispered her thanks to Usami again and again.</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">The</span> <span class="S-T3">gentle</span> <span class="S-T3">and</span> <span class="S-T3">frag</span><span class="S-T3">ile</span> <span class="S-T3">girl</span> <span class="S-T3">at</span> <span class="S-T3">that</span> <span class="S-T3">moment</span> <span class="S-T3">did</span> <span class="S-T3">not</span> <span class="S-T3">look</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">least</span> <span class="S-T3">like</span> <span class="S-T3">someone</span> <span class="S-T3">who</span> <span class="S-T3">would</span> <span class="S-T3">plan</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">murder</span> <span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">me.</span>&nbsp;</p>

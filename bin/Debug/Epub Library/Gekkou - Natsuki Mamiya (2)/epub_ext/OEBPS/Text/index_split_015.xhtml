  <p class="P-P7"><span class="S-T">80%</span> is quite a high probability.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">If, for example, you get 80 points in a 100 point test, nobody’s going to complain, or if you go outside without an umbrella even though the weather forecast has predicted rain with a probability of 80%, you’re just reckless. Now, having said that:</p>

  <p class="P-P8"><span class="S-T3">Of</span> <span class="S-T3">ten</span> <span class="S-T3">candidates</span> <span class="S-T3">eight</span> <span class="S-T3">are</span> <span class="S-T3">awarded</span> <span class="S-T3">a</span> <span class="S-T3">prize</span> <span class="S-T3">in</span> <span class="S-T3">the</span> <span class="S-T3">final</span> <span class="S-T3">selection.</span> <span class="S-T3">It’s</span> <span class="S-T3">not</span> <span class="S-T3">possible</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T4">not</span><span class="S-T3">&nbsp;</span><span class="S-T3">to</span> <span class="S-T3">start</span> <span class="S-T3">dreaming,</span> <span class="S-T3">is</span> <span class="S-T3">it?</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">“If I won, I could use the prize money as an initial payment for a new car!”, “I could easily buy the Blu-ray box of Stellvia!” Who can blame me for having such empty dreams?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">But as you may know, the result was communicated to me with the words “It is with deep regret that we must…” and thus crushed the modest and fragile dreams of a petit bourgeois like me with the same destructive power as an iron hammer.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">However! As the saying goes, when one door shuts, another opens.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">“It is with deep regret that we must tell you that your submitted work has failed the selection. We are, however, very eager to make it accessible to the public.”</p>

  <p class="P-P7">No hesitation. Like a shot! I raised my voice and came clear:</p>

  <p class="P-P7">“I refuse!”</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I would have given my right arm for such a compelling offer. Having a book published through the admired Dengeki Bunko label<span class="S-T">—</span>a dream for a book author like me. However, my pride is on the line. I want to stay on the orange-juice side of things whatever happens! One day, I want to win that prize with my own power and proudly open the doors to ASCII Media Works. This is my firm determination.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Ah, come to think of it, I haven’t introduced myself yet. How unmindful of me. My name is Natsuki Mamiya and I have had the honor to make my debut at Dengeki Bunko with my novel “Gekkou”.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">…err, well. Look! Does pride fill your stomach? Can you buy a new car with pride?! What would you do, dear readers?</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Crumple that useless pride and woooooooooooooooooooosh there it goes flying into the bin!</p>

  <p class="P-P7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P7">The acknowledgment.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Yuzame-sama and Kumeta-sama, it’s thanks to you that “Gekkou” exists. I thank you with all my heart. By the way, who should I charge for the Blu-ray box of Stellvia? I’m waiting for your contact.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">I also would like to thank Shiromiso-sama and the other parties involved in the making of the gorgeous illustrations.</p>

  <p class="P-P7">Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, my little sister, my friends and all the other people I know… or so I thought, but I’ll just tell them after I finish writing this, since that’s much faster.</p>
